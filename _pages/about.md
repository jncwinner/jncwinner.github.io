Justin Carpenter holds a Ph.D. in Computing with an emphasis in Computer Science from Boise State University, specializing in Machine Learning, Graph Representation Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. He also earned his Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Boise State, where his journey into advanced algorithms, AI, and data-driven solutions first took shape.

Throughout his academic and research experiences, Justin has been driven by a passion for exploring the cutting-edge of technology. His work focuses on leveraging machine learning and graph-based representations to solve complex, real-world problems and to generate actionable insights from large-scale data. His research contributions include projects on temporal graph representation learning, higher-order structural representations, botnet detection through structural node representation, as well as scalable structural graph partition algorithms. These efforts have been presented at respected international conferences, such as VLDB and IEEE Big Data, highlighting his commitment to advancing knowledge and innovation in the field.

In addition to his research background, Justin is proficient in Python, Java, C#, and SQL, and is experienced with machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. His journey has also included mentoring roles, where he served as a teaching assistant in machine learning, data structures, and large-scale data analysis courses, helping students develop foundational skills and a deeper understanding of these complex areas.

Outside his work, Justin enjoys exploring the outdoors, working on personal coding projects, developing plugins and designing maps for games, hosting servers (games, media, storage, LLMs, and networking) for his community, and keeping up with the latest advancements in technology. He is driven by the potentials of machine learning to transform how we understand and interpret data in the modern world.
