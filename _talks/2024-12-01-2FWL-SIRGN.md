This talk introduced 2FWL-SIRGN, a scalable approach to graph representation learning that combines the 2-dimensional Folklore Weisfeiler Lehman Isomorphism Test with novel structural graph partitioning. This work addresses the limitations of higher-order graph representations and is designed for efficient application in large-scale graph data environments.
